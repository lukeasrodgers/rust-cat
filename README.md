# rust-cat

Implementation of a bastardized combination of BSD and GNU `cat` in rust, as a learning exercise.

For a real implemenation, see https://github.com/uutils/coreutils.

At this point, mostly works, but buggy, control over buffering is untested and possibly broken, lots of duplicate code, formatting and line numbering will
break for very large files, code is badly organized, etc.
